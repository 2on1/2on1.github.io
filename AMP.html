<p>The Portland Trail Blazers earned the No. 3 seed in a competitive Western Conference largely through the strength of their backcourt. Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum combined to average 48.3 points per game this season, the second-best number for a guard combo in the NBA (only James Harden and Chris Paul averaged more).</p> 
<p>Lillard in particular has been special. He averaged 26.9 points and 6.6 assists, and he’s a good bet to earn 1st Team All-NBA honors for his efforts. </p>
<p>So far, and it’s early, he’s been absolutely manhandled by New Orleans’ Jrue Holiday.</p>
<p>It starts with defense. Lillard has averaged 17.5 points through two first-round playoff games, down 9.4 from his regular season average -- despite taking 1.1 more shots per game in this series. You could chalk this up to gameplanning or strong team defense, but according to NBA.com, Lillard has shot 2-for-18 when Holiday guards him (11.1 percent) and 11-for-23 (47.8 percent) when everyone else does.</p>
<p>But Holiday isn’t just a low-usage defensive stopper in the mold of Andre Roberson or Luc Mbah-a-Moute. No, the New Orleans guard averaged a career-high 19 points and 6 assists this season, and he’s kicked it up another notch in the postseason. Right now, he’s averaging 27 points per game on 54.5 percent shooting -- better on both counts than either of Portland’s guards have mustered.</p>
              <p>New Orleans Head Coach Alvin Gentry said after a Game 2 win (in which Holiday scored 33 points, helping the Pelicans to a 2-0 start) that he might be biased, but he couldn’t name a better two-way player in the NBA right now. It sounds crazy, but Holiday’s offense stems from the same place as his defense: his size and athleticism.</p>

<p>According to NBADraft.net, Holiday measured 6’4.25” in shoes with a 6’7” wingspan and an 8’4.5” standing reach in the 2009 NBA Draft Combine. At first blush, Lillard doesn’t seem much smaller -- according to the same site, Lillard measured 6’2.75” in shoes and had a 6’7.75” wingspan. But, Lillard’s standing reach was 8’ flat, meaning that Holiday is four or five inches taller than Lillard just by sticking his hand out.</p>
<p>Holiday is also listed as about 10 pounds heavier (205 to 195) than Lillard, but watch these highlights, and it will feel like more. Sometimes, this isn’t a problem, but Holiday is a good enough shooter (36 percent from three his career) to keep Lillard from just slacking in the paint.</p>
<p>Instead, Lillard has to go over the top of screens, and when he does, Holiday uses his size advantage to seal Lillard behind him for what feels like forever. When Lillard guards him too closely, he zips past him and shoots over defenders in the paint with either hand -- often even preferring to finish with the left, making him unconventional and harder to defend.</p>
