<h4>FOOTNOTE 1: WHO IS JARROD UTHOFF?</h4>
<p><b>Season Honors:</b> Consensus 2nd Team All-American, 1st Team All-Big Ten, Wooden Award Finalist, Academic All-American of the Year</p>
<p><b>Season Stats:</b> 30.8 minutes, 18.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 1.0 steals, 2.5 blocks, 44.8% FG, 38.2% 3FG, 81.3% FT</p> 
<p>The 6'9", 215-pound combo forward from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, leapt onto the national scene this season by scoring 30 points in the first half against then-No. 4 Iowa State and leading the Hawkeyes to a No. 3 ranking in the AP Poll, the best ranking for Iowa since before Uthoff was born. The Hawkeyes struggled down the stretch, finishing the season ranked 25th and losing to eventual-champion Villanova in the second round of the NCAA Tournament as Uthoff struggled with his outside shot and slid down mock drafts.</p> 
<p>That said, Uthoff isn't a one-game or one-year wonder. In his three seasons at Iowa (he redshirted his first two seasons, one year at Wisconsin and one at Iowa), the Hawkeyes made the Tournament every season - another accomplishment Iowa hadn't achieved since Uthoff was born in 1993. Uthoff played in all 100 of the Hawkeyes' games over that timeframe, going 64-36.</p>
<p>In his junior season, Uthoff joined Denzel Valentine as a 3rd Team All-Big Ten selection before becoming, along with fellow seniors Valentine and Yogi Ferrell, one of three players named as a unanimous 1st Team All-Big Ten player in 2016. Even before that, Uthoff was a great prep player, being named Mr. Basketball in Iowa in 2011.</p></div>

<p>arrod Uthoff is perhaps the least exciting 2nd Team All-American in recent memory. A fifth-year senior who spent his first two seasons as a redshirt at Wisconsin and then Iowa, Uthoff looks more like a stretched-out version of that good high school player you know than a McDonald’s All-American. And really, he looks that way because he <I>is</I> more like a stretched-out version of that good high school player you know than a McDonald’s All-American.  He’s never jumped particularly well or run particularly fast, and as a scrawny high schooler he was ranked outside of Scout’s top 100 players. His jumper is a two-part set shot that makes it seem as though he’s spent more time practicing one-handed form shots than playing in games. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details1');">[1]</a></p>

<p>Even Uthoff’s choice of college lacks sex appeal outside the Midwest. Although the state of Iowa had three teams in the NCAA Tournament this season (going 4-3), it just isn’t considered a hotbed of talent the way other Big Ten states like Indiana and Wisconsin might be. Consider this: since the 2012-2013 NCAA season, only two second-team All-Americans have gone undrafted since the 2012-13 season. Both of them (Iowa State’s Melvin Ejim and Northern Iowa’s Seth Tuttle) played their collegiate basketball in Iowa. Iowa State forward Georges Niang, another 2nd Team All-American this season, might also go undrafted. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details2');">[2]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 2: IS IOWA OVERLOOKED?</h4>
<p><b>States with 5+ AP All-American Selections Since 2014:</b> Kentucky (7), North Carolina (6), Kansas (5), <b>Iowa (5)</b></p>
<p>When you think of basketball states, you probably think of Kentucky, Carolina, and Kansas, but you probably don't think about Iowa. That said, there's been a ton of talent to play in Iowa over the last half-decade. Not only have universities in the state of Iowa featured 5 AP All-American selections since 2014, but 3-time All-American Doug McDermott and starting Warriors forward Harrison Barnes played their high school ball in the Hawkeye State, too.</p>
<p>Yet, in the past 5 years the only 1st-round pick from the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, or Northern Iowa was Royce White, who played in 3 total games in his NBA career when he couldn't overcome his fear of flying. White was drafted 16th overall by the Houston Rockets in 2012, 19 picks ahead of Draymond Green and 23 spots ahead of Khris Middleton.</p>

<div class=left>
<div class=left-container>
<div class=text>
<p>Now think about this: most mock drafts have Wisconsin junior power forward Nigel Hayes ranked ahead of Uthoff, citing his defensive versatility and shooting form. This already seems a little weird, given that Uthoff was better by almost every statistic while playing on a more successful team, but it gets even stranger when you consider that Uthoff would most likely have started in Hayes’ place had he stayed at Wisconsin. Hayes was the higher-rated high school prospect of the two, but only marginally so, and Uthoff (who would have been a redshirt sophomore by the time Hayes entered college) would more likely have been the third piece to a Badgers team that made the 2015 National Title Game. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details3');">[3]</a> </p>

<div class="uthoffthree"><img src=https://admin2.scout.com/sites/default/files/2016/05/03/Uthoff-Kaminsky-720.jpg width=100%>
<h4>FOOTNOTE 3: THE WISCONSIN SAGA</h4>
<p>Uthoff originally signed his National Letter of Intent with Wisconsin on the same day as Frank Kaminsky. Uthoff was ranked one spot ahead of Kaminsky on <a href=http://www.scout.com/college/basketball/recruiting/topic/2011-basketball-prospects?type=players&start=115 target=_blank>Scout's 2011 rankings</a>, but where Kaminsky played four seasons for the Badgers, eventually winning National Player of the Year honors in 2015, Uthoff never played a game for Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Instead, Uthoff redshirted his freshman season and then announced his intention to transfer. Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan <a href=http://www.scout.com/college/wisconsin/story/1192801-uthoff-to-iowa target=_blank>infamously restricted Uthoff's choice of transfer schools</a>, first disallowing him from taking a scholarship at <i>26 Division I schools</i> (all of the Big Ten, all of the ACC, Marquette, Florida, and Iowa State), before lifting all transfer restrictions other than those on the Big Ten.</p>
<p>Uthoff chose to go to Iowa anyway, forfeiting a scholarship his first year in Iowa City while redshirting for a second consecutive season. He never beat the Badgers in his career, going 0-5.</P>
<h4><a class="authorbig fourclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details3');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4></div></div>

<p>Now, instead of being an intriguing, high-upside pick like Sam Dekker or even Hayes, Uthoff is struggling to stay relevant in the draft. And for all of his collegiate credentials, which outweigh both of the Badgers’ forwards, it makes sense. He lacks the elite explosion you look for in a draft prospect, and he’ll be 23 years old at the time of the draft. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details4');">[4]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 4: IS UTHOFF TOO OLD?</h4>
<p>By almost every measure, being 23 years old makes you a young man. But in an age of one-and-done’s, a 23-year-old college player is considered old. A finished product with no room for potential – particularly in contrast to a player who could play out his entire rookie contract before turning 23.</p> 
<p>Uthoff is already 23, and that will scare away a lot of NBA teams. Or, at least, it has in the past. Just 4 players 23 or older were drafted last season. Of them, only Utah point guard Delon Wright was taken in the first round (20th overall to Toronto). </p>
<p>He’s also the only one of them on an NBA roster. Rakeem Christmas (the 36th pick), Sir’Dominic Pointer (53rd), and Cady Lalanne (55th) are currently in the D-League.</p> 
<p>Another thing to note: fellow All-American Iowa State forward Georges Niang will be 23 at the time of the draft as well. He, too, might go undrafted.</p> 
<h4><a class="authorbig fiveclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details4');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>

<p>The question, though, is not about whether Uthoff is an exciting talent. The question is whether Jarrod Uthoff is an <i>NBA</i> talent. And for as much as players are drafted on potential, these are not the same thing. Danny Green, Zaza Pachulia, and Anthony Tolliver aren’t exciting, but they’re valuable contributors on playoff teams. They were also all second-round picks, like Uthoff might be. So can Uthoff contribute? Can he be an NBA defender? Can he contribute offensively? <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details5');">[5]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 5: ON THE DRAFT BUBBLE</h4>
<p>So what exactly do Uthoff's draft prospects look like?</p>
<p>It sort of depends on where you look, but even the most optimistic mock drafts only have Uthoff going late in the second round. DraftExpress is perhaps the most bullish on the Iowan forward, and they have him going <a href=http://www.draftexpress.com/nba-mock-draft/2016/ target=_blank>47th overall to the Orlando Magic.</a> NBADraft.net has him going <a href=http://www.nbadraft.net/2016mock_draft target=_blank>58th.</a> Most other mocks have Uthoff going undrafted.</p>
<p>I have more optimism. On the road against Iowa State, in a rivalry game filled with NBA scouts, Uthoff absolutely torched the Cyclones, scoring 30 points in the <i>1st half</i> while also locking down All-American Georges Niang. He only finished the game with 32 points, but that 1st half is hard to forget.</p>

<div class=text>
<h4 class=question>CAN HE BE AN NBA DEFENDER? </h4>
<p>Let's start with this one, as it's the easiest to answer. No, Uthoff probably can’t guard the biggest power forwards in the NBA like LaMarcus Aldridge. He probably can’t guard the most dynamic small forwards in the NBA like Kevin Durant, either. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details6');">[6]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 6: ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS</h4>
<p>Questions you hear a lot around draft time: <i>Can he guard LeBron James? Can he guard Russell Westbrook?</i> The answer is almost always no. There's a reason that superstars are superstars, and the reason is that they can consistently beat 1-on-1 matchups. Throw in the concept of pick-and-rolls, and it's really hard for even a great defender to hold his own.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to be supremely athletic or a great 1-on-1 player to be a good defender. Really, you just have to play your role.</p>
<p>In a sense, an NBA defense is a lot like an NFL’s offensive line – it doesn’t matter how good four of the guys are if there’s an obvious weak spot the opponent can attack. Think about the Carolina Panthers in the Super Bowl. Before the season, most experts agreed that, while the interior of their offensive line was terrific, the Panthers needed to upgrade their offensive tackles. This didn’t show itself so much over the course of the regular season or playoffs, but Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware had their way in the most important game of the year by blitzing off the edges.</p>
<p>Similarly, Golden State attacks Zach Randolph every time they play Memphis, forcing him to guard Curry as much as possible. The Warriors will use whoever Randolph is guarding as the screener in pick-and-rolls to make sure they get the matchup they want. It doesn’t matter how good Memphis’ perimeter defense is – if Curry gets matched up against Randolph, it should be a basket.</p>
<p>What you need, then, is not a player that excels at guarding Draymond Green in the post, but a player that can both guard Draymond Green in the post <i>and</i> not embarrass himself when he has to hedge against a quicker ball-handler. You need a guy that can chase Klay Thompson around down screens and switch onto Harrison Barnes in a pinch. You need versatile players who can fill a bunch of different roles, work hard, and understand defensive rotations. </p>
<p>It might not be as sexy as finding the next Kawhi Leonard, but finding players who fit a team’s defensive scheme is just as important – and a heck of a lot easier.</p>
<h4><a class="authorbig eightclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details6');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>

<p>That said, there’s no question Uthoff can find a way to defend at an NBA level, particularly given the right matchup. It might not be obvious every night whether his natural position is at the 3 or the 4, but he’s one of the few players that just <i>gets</i> defense. He led the Big Ten in blocks per game with 2.61 and finished third among all major conference players. He finished his career 6th in Big Ten history in blocks per game. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details7');">[7]</a></p>

<div class=markernine></div><div class=grayline></div>
<div class="right hide" id="details7">
<div class="uthoffeight"><video controls muted preload="auto" class="video" poster="https://admin2.scout.com/sites/default/files/2016/05/04/Uthoff-150-Blocks-Thumbnail.jpg" src="https://admin2.scout.com/sites/default/files/2016/05/13/Uthoff%20150%20Blocks2.mp4" width=100%></video>
<h4>FOOTNOTE 7: "GETTING" DEFENSE</h4>
<p>This play moves so quickly it's hard to see, but it also really exemplifies what makes Uthoff's defense special. Guarding the farthest man from the ball on a side out-of-bounds play, Uthoff isn't part of the main action on this play. According to traditional coaching, then, Uthoff really <i>shouldn't</i> be in position to block this shot. That responsibility should be shared between Dom Uhl and Peter Jok. When Jok gets pinned on a back screen to the rim, though, Uthoff is already in motion, moving in sync with Northwestern's Tre Demps toward the rim.</p>
<p>Demps, who can't see Uthoff moving behind him, assumes he's getting an easy layup and tries to put the shot up quickly. But Uthoff is already there, getting a piece and starting an Iowa fast break.</p>
<p>The speed at which Uthoff gets to the ball - even though it's probably not his responsibility - is remarkable, even though he never seems to be moving quickly. He doesn't jump particularly high, but he gets enough of the ball to turn an easy bucket into a miss.</p>
<p>Basically, Uthoff just saved two points by being aware, making an effort, and using his length without fouling. It’s simple stuff, but it matters - two points per game is basically the difference between the Miami Heat, who finished the regular season 3rd in the Eastern Conference with a +1.6 point differential, and the Washington Wizards, who missed the playoffs with a -0.5 point differential.</p>
<h4><a class="authorbig nineclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details7');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>

<p>That’s pretty crazy, considering that Uthoff is not particularly long (he measured 6’9.75” at the NBA Combine with a 6’11.5” wingspan). By comparison, the five players who averaged more blocks were, on average, 6’11” with 7’2.5” wingspans – low-post players who blocked shots around the rim. Meanwhile, Uthoff guarded both forward spots and on the perimeter. Those five other players also averaged more fouls per game than Uthoff. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details8');">[8]</a> </p>
<div class=markerten></div><div class=grayline></div>
<div class="right hide" id="details8">
<div class="uthoffnine"><video controls muted preload="auto" poster="https://admin2.scout.com/sites/default/files/2016/05/04/Jarrod-Uthoff-3-Point-Block-vs-Thumbnail.jpg" src="https://admin2.scout.com/sites/default/files/2016/05/13/Jarrod%20Uthoff%203-Point%20Block%20vs.%20Illinois%202.mp4" width=100%></video>
<h4>FOOTNOTE 8: 3-POINT SHOT-BLOCKER</h4>
<p>Another difference between Uthoff and those other shot-blockers? The Iowan forward blocked a <i>ton</i> of 3-point tries – more than not only every other player in Division I, but more than almost every team in the country. Usually, you’d assume someone could only block 3-pointers on a regular basis by either gambling or staying overly attached to his man, but watch Uthoff in the play above and you’ll see that Uthoff isn’t doing either of these things.</p>
<p>He starts the play by taking a step toward the Illinois penetration, ready to help, before closing out short (the way Uthoff closes out, stopping and setting his feet at the elbow, is impressive, because it implies he remembers the scouting report in a scrambling situation. His man, Illinois freshman Aaron Jordan, attempted just one 3-pointer per game and made just 29% of his tries). He jumps after Jordan leaves his feet, which ensures that he won’t be fooled by a pump fake, and still somehow manages to get a piece of the ball.</p>
<p>But freeze the frame just as Jordan, who is 6'5", starts his shooting motion, and it looks like he’s wide open. Jordan even gets the ball out of his hands cleanly, and it isn’t until the ball is already a foot in the air that Uthoff blocks it. That’s not a bad shot, but Uthoff’s length makes it one. </p>
<h4><a class="authorbig tenclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details8');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>

<p>His defensive game most reminds me of another Iowan star: Harrison Barnes. You might not think of Barnes as a defensive stud, and he isn’t. Unlike Uthoff, he isn’t much of a shot-blocker (he had just one more block than 5’9” Isaiah Thomas this year) and he doesn’t get a ton of steals. He might not even be one of the five best defenders on an admittedly-great defensive team. But Barnes’ versatility is essential to the Warriors’ identity. Yes, Draymond Green can guard centers in the Warriors’ small-ball lineup, but that wouldn’t matter if there was no one to guard opposing teams’ forwards. And while Barnes couldn’t defend James in the Finals, he did hold his own in the Western Conference semis against Zach Randolph, allowing Andrew Bogut to play free safety and effectively render the poor-shooting-but-pesky Tony Allen unplayable. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details9');">[9]</a> </p>

<div class="uthofften"><img src=https://admin2.scout.com/sites/default/files/2016/05/03/Uthoff-Battier-Color.jpg width=100%>
<h4>FOOTNOTE 9: ANOTHER NBA COMPARISON</h4>
<p>Uthoff also plays a lot like Duke's Shane Battier.</p> 
<p>Battier, the last player in college basketball to average 2 blocks and 2 3-pointers per game before Uthoff accomplished it this season, measures remarkably similarly to Uthoff coming out of college. While Uthoff is slighter than Battier, both players are about the same height with about the same wingspan. Both averaged the same number of blocks per game over their careers (1.7), though Battier racked up more steals than Uthoff while being named a three-time NABC Defensive Player of the Year.</p>
<p>My favorite similarity is that both Battier and Uthoff were named Academic All-America of the Year their senior seasons.</p>
<p>Battier was drafted 6th overall after winning the National Championship in 2001, before playing 13 seasons in the NBA. He won two titles with the Miami Heat and was twice named to the NBA All-Defensive 2nd Team (2007-09).</p>
<h4><a class="authorbig elevenclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details9');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>

<p>Pop in some Iowa tape and you’ll see Uthoff showing that same versatility. This season, he often guarded the opposing team’s best player, whether it was Denzel Valentine (a point guard, if an unconventional one) or Georges Niang, a combo forward. And while there are moments where Uthoff looks outmatched in these different scenarios, he usually finds a way to leverage his height and solid footwork to force the ball-handler into difficult shots. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details10');">[10]</a> </p>
<div class=markertwelve></div><div class=grayline></div>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 10: DEFENSIVE VERSATILITY</h4>
<p>Everyone likes to focus on matchups in sports, and the NBA is worse about this than other leagues. Listen to sports radio or go to a bar and you’ll hear different opinions about who should guard who in any given game. But while halfcourt matchups are important, they are also often irrelevant – particularly in transition scenarios like this one.</p>
<p>In times like these, a defense has to be flexible enough to abandon their pre-scripted matchups and just make sure everyone is covered. Here, Uthoff’s man Georges Niang is already covered, so Uthoff scrambles to the next open man. In this case, that’s Iowa State guard Nazareth Mitrou-Long, who’s standing in the strong-side corner. </p>
<p>While Mitrou-Long struggled with a hip injury through 8 games before seeking a medical redshirt in 2015-16, he finished 2nd in the Big 12 in made 3-pointers the season before. That kind of shooting touch forces Uthoff to close out long from a dead sprint, which should usually make for a simple pump fake and drive for an easy shot. </p>
<p>The fact that Uthoff not only gets in position to potentially block the 3-pointer, but then is able to slide his feet and corral the straight-line drive to the rim is about as impressive of a defensive play as a 6’10” guy can make.</p>
<h4><a class="authorbig twelveclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details10');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>

<p>He’s not a perfect defender. He’s just an average collegiate rebounder (he often ball-watches instead of boxing out, and he’s not a good enough jumper to overcome that at the next level), and there are times where he’s a half-second late on his rotation. His defensive stance is often too upright, and when he gets into a stance his weight can shift too far forward, which makes it difficult to stop drives. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details11');">[11]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 11: DEFENSIVE WEAKNESSES</h4>
<p>Here’s where you get nervous if you’re trying to project Uthoff as an NBA power forward. He has two opportunities to grab a defensive rebound here, but doesn’t box out Indiana wing Troy Williams on the first chance and gets outjumped by forward Collin Hartman for the second. Both Hartman and Williams were listed at 6’7”, 215 pounds – smaller than Atlanta Hawks shooting guard Thabo Sefolosha.</p>
<p>Some of this is fixable. If Uthoff just boxes out properly on the first effort, he gets the rebound without having to outjump or outmuscle anyone. Even so, do we really want him trying to box out Amir Johnson and Taj Gibson when he’s struggling against Big Ten forwards?</p>
<p>You can see a lack of elite explosion in other areas, too. At the college level, Uthoff is long enough to bother most shots without jumping particularly high. But when he’s late on a rotation, he doesn’t have enough athleticism to overcome it. Check out this play:</p>
<video controls muted preload="auto" poster="https://admin2.scout.com/sites/default/files/2016/05/04/Uthoff-vs.-Purdue-Thumbnail.jpg" src="https://admin2.scout.com/sites/default/files/2016/05/13/Uthoff%20vs.%20Purdue%202.mp4" width=100%></video>
<p>Uthoff sees the play and rotates in time, but he can’t elevate with Purdue guard Johnny Hill (who has the advantage of a full running start to the rim). Hill is just 6’3”, so he’s giving up about 7 inches on this play, but he still finishes over Uthoff for an easy bucket.</p>
<p>That means Uthoff has to make doubly sure he does all of his work early, because Johnny Hill becomes Russell Westbrook at the next level.</p>

<p>But this isn’t an iso-only NBA anymore, and team defense matters more than ever. You wouldn’t say that teams like the Boston Celtics or Atlanta Hawks have a ton of great isolation defenders, but both of them ranked in the top 5 in defensive efficiency this season by relying on their concepts and helping on a string. Uthoff is the sort of player who could thrive in a defense like that. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details12');">[12]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 12: PLAYING WITHIN A TEAM SCHEME</h4>
<p>This play is Uthoff at his best, and it shows how he can be an NBA defender without elite athleticism. He does his work early against Georges Niang, making the entry pass difficult and pushing Niang out to nearly the 3-point line.</p>
<p>Niang’s bulk pushes Uthoff off of his spot about a step, but Uthoff still forces Niang to his right shoulder and the baseline, where Uthoff has help. Staying straight up and not panicking when Niang turns toward the rim, Uthoff then uses his length to force Niang from taking an off-balance reverse layup. Instead, he tries to kick the ball to the corner. However, Iowa guard Peter Jok is in good position, leading to an errant pass and a turnover.</p>
<p>Because Niang is now out of bounds, Uthoff has a huge head start in transition, galloping down the center of the court for a dunk. It’s great isolation defense that turned into easy offense on the other end, and Uthoff never had to outjump or outmuscle anyone to do it.</p>

<h4 class=question>CAN HE CONTRIBUTE OFFENSIVELY? </h4>
<p>This one is a little more difficult to project than his defense. Watch Uthoff in the first half against Iowa State this season, when he scored 30 points, and you think the guy could be special offensively. Continue to the second half, when he scored just 2, and you think otherwise. Much of his inconsistency is due to his lack of explosion and the hitch in his jumper, which prevents him from creating easy shots for himself. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details13');">[13]</a></p>
<div class=markerfifteen></div><div class=grayline></div>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 13: MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SCORER</h4>
<p>Uthoff has an intriguing, unconventional offensive skillset, and he showed a ton of that skillset in the first half against Iowa State. Deep threes, one-legged stepbacks, and driving dunks – everything was going for him.</p>
<p>You can see one of the oddities of Uthoff’s offensive game here. Most right-handed players prefer to drive all the way to the rim when going right – it’s more difficult to pull up going right, and it’s easier to finish around the rim – and pull up for jumpers going left. There are a few exceptions, Gordon Hayward being perhaps the most notable of them. Uthoff is another, preferring to pull up when going right – particularly with a between-the-legs dribble to get open – and finish at the rim when going left.</p>
<p>It works well for Uthoff, who can use his shoulders and height as leverage against his relatively slow shot form. So, when Uthoff drives right and steps back here, Iowa State forward Abdel Nader has to respect Uthoff’s ability to take the midrange shot. He takes one step too many, and Uthoff blows by him for a pretty left-handed dunk.</p>
<h4><a class="authorbig fifteenclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details13');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>

<p>Stylistically, his offensive game looks a lot like Dirk Nowitzki's. But Dirk’s moves work because he’s one of the best shooters on the planet and he’s 7-feet tall. Uthoff will probably never be able to claim the former and will certainly never claim the latter, which means that his isolation game in the NBA will, most likely, be limited. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details14');">[14]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 14: BREAKING DOWN UTHOFF'S POST PLAY</h4>
<p>This is a pretty simple play – just a reverse pivot out of the mid-post into a jump shot – and the degree of difficulty in each shot is also different. Uthoff is taking this shot over 6’9” Michigan State forward Gavin Schilling, who had just 8 blocks this season. Nowitzki is taking his jumper over 7’ center Andrew Bynum, who once blocked 10 shots in a single game.</p>
<p>That said, you can see Uthoff’s pace, footwork, and shooting form are similar to Dirk’s. Watch Uthoff for an extended amount of time, and you’ll see a lot of Nowitzki’s influence in his game. He loves taking one-legged fadeaway jumpers when driving left, and he uses his body to create separation when he isn’t quick enough to do so otherwise.</p>
<p>But Uthoff’s post game – as would be expected – isn’t anywhere near as polished as Nowitzki’s. He can struggle to establish and maintain his position, even against younger defenders. Nowitzki, meanwhile, is a wizard at getting to his spots and is big enough and long enough to make contested catches. Uthoff also doesn’t get fouled as often as Nowitzki did at his peak, due in part to the fact that he usually prefers to take jump shots rather than finish over bigger, stronger defenders.</p>
<p>Oh, and Uthoff isn’t one of the best shooters in NBA history, either. So there’s that.</p>
<h4><a class="authorbig sixteenclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details14');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>


<p>That's fine. If you can’t score as a primary ball-handler, there are three basic ways you can still help your team offensively - by becoming a good cutter, a good offensive rebounder, or a good shooter. Uthoff will probably never be an above-average finisher in the NBA, and he’s not Tristan Thompson on the offensive glass. But he has shown the ability to develop into a good spot shooter, which would make a massive difference in his career development. If he can shoot 38% from three as a pro – about the rate he shot from deep in college – that puts him in the Channing Frye range. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details15');">[15]</a></p>
<div class=markerseventeen></div><div class=grayline></div>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 15: RELIABLE 3-POINT SHOOTER?</h4>
<p>Uthoff shot 38% from deep both for his career and in his final season, which is right on the border of being an excellent 3-point shooter. To add further confusion, he took a ton of deep 3’s, like the one above – over half of his attempts were from NBA range.</p>
<p>In the 20 games I charted, Uthoff shot 30/89 from the NBA 3-point line (33.7%). That percentage is identical to Charlotte Hornets rookie Frank Kaminsky, an NBA stretch big who is the same age as Uthoff, and a tiny bit better than Kristaps Porzingis (33.3%).</p>
<p>Considering that 29 out of 30 NBA teams shot at least 33% from three (only the Lakers shot worse), it also isn’t very good. That’s not surprising – rookies are, on average, worse shooters than veterans.</p>
<p>Uthoff’s shot form is simple and clean. If he gets playing time, he should have plenty of opportunities to launch uncontested jumpers at the next level – implying that he should be able to improve as he gets more repetitions. That’s key, as he lacks consistency right now. After all, he took 7 NBA-range 3-pointers in this game against Temple, and this is the only one he made.</p>
<h4><a class="authorbig seventeenclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details15');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>


<p>That would make Uthoff a legit threat in a pick-and-pop and force opposing defenses to close out long on him – making it more difficult for them to corral him on drives to the rim and potentially compensating for his lack of foot speed. He has the ball-handling chops to pump fake, drive, and kick at the next level, but it won’t matter if no one respects his ability to shoot. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details16');">[16]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 16: GUARD-LIKE BALL SKILLS</h4>
<p>When you hear people talking about bigger players with guard skills, it usually means one of two things – that they can shoot 3’s or drive for layups. Not to reverence Frank Kaminsky too much, but you heard it a lot about him last season. Kaminsky really didn't have a guard’s ball-handling skillset, though. He could drive with either hand, and could spin if he got cut off.</p>
<p>That’s still really impressive for a 7-footer, but it doesn’t mean guard skills. Guard skills imply that a player can handle the ball in the pick-and-roll, that he has multiple counters and change of pace ability. That’s what Uthoff shows here, in a less-impressive, less-athletic version of the Michael Jordan vs. the Knicks play.</p>
<p>Uthoff uses behind-the-back, spin, hesitation, and crossover moves with either hand before finishing on the opposite side of the rim with a wrong-legged jump. It’s a play that would work if he were 6’4” instead of 6’10”, and, combined with his low turnover rate (just 6.4%, a rate usually associated with spot shooters rather than leading scorers), shows he has real potential as a driver.</p> 
<h4><a class="authorbig eighteenclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details16');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>


<p>Outside of that, Uthoff is also an asset in transition. Due to his ability to cover multiple players on the other end of the court, he often found himself wide open as opposing teams scrambled to find him. This can lead to wide-open threes (which, again, only matters if Uthoff develops into a good shooter) or defensive mismatches. Think about the way the Warriors use odd-ball lineups to create havoc in the fullcourt. Uthoff would be a great fourth or fifth option in bench units, guarding either forward (or, possibly, two-guards as well) and then running to the three-point line to spread the floor on offense. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details17');">[17]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 17: TRANSITION THREAT</h4>
<p>This is what Uthoff could be at the next level. Indiana freshman forward OG Anunoby projects as an NBA-level defender, but he’s trailing Uthoff in transition and doesn’t run hard enough to get attached early. Usually, you can get away with doing this against a collegiate power forward. Usually, when a team is down 13 in the first half of a road game, a power forward wouldn’t have the confidence to take an NBA 3-pointer with 25 seconds left on the shot clock.</p>
<p>Uthoff steps into the shot and swishes it. Uthoff punished teams like Temple, who tried putting their best big-man defender on Uthoff, by creating cross-matches and knocking down wide-open looks on the fast break.</p>

<h4 class=question>THE BOTTOM LINE</h4>
<p>Take a look at the 2nd-round picks and undrafted players who have established themselves as legitimate NBA players – particularly NBA wings – and you can see a trend of what we missed in the scouting process. Jae Crowder, Danny Green, Paul Millsap, Chandler Parsons, and Draymond Green are all max players or close to it, but in college there were questions about their ability to do one of two things – defend against NBA talent and shoot. We could even throw Jimmy Butler in this group, as he was the last pick of the first round in 2011. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details18');">[18]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 18: FUNNY SCOUTING QUOTES IN RETROSPECT</h4>
<p><i>(Note: Scouting is hard. I thought Anthony Bennett was the best player in the 2013 draft. We all get stuff wrong, and 2nd-round picks are harder to project, as they rarely get as many opportunities as 1st-rounders.)</i></p>
<p><a href=http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Paul-Millsap-299/ target=_blank>Draft Express on Paul Millsap</a></p>
<p>"Millsap definitely is not an amazing man to man defender. His lateral quickness is just decent guarding big men on the perimeter, and he has a tendency to take possessions off as many players in his situation in college are forced to do because of the way their team relies on them on the other end of the floor." </p>

<p>"He's a power forward with shooting guard hype, but he's a smart player who works as hard as anyone and can contribute, one way or another, right away. There are a lot of better players available [at 34], though." </p>

<p>These are the same questions we have about Uthoff. Can he guard NBA players? Can he shoot well enough to contribute offensively? We won’t actually know until he’s in the NBA for a few years, but there is a reason to think he’s more like the players who have been successful than those that haven’t made the cut. Read excerpts about the guys above in college, and the same words tend to show up. The words “high basketball IQ” appear a lot in their scouting reports, as does the word “versatile.” You’ll see often that these types of players are “a little better defensively than you’d expect.” Most importantly, all of these players won a lot and improved a lot in college. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details19');">[19]</a></p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 19: THE "NBA-READY" MYTH</h4>
<p>Other phrases you hear a lot with upperclassmen prospects is that they are more “polished” or “ready to contribute right away.” And while it makes sense logically that an older, more experienced player should be more ready to contribute earlier, <a href=http://www.scout.com/story/1604899-are-seniors-really-more-nba-ready>there really isn’t evidence</a> to suggest that’s true.</p>
<p>The NBA is just different from college, and most players needs time to adjust. Draymond Green was the 9th-worst player in the NBA his rookie season according to PER, and Danny Green had to play several seasons overseas before getting a real shot, but both players were lauded for their NBA readiness during the draft process. That’s one of the reasons scouting the NBA draft is so tough. Unless you’re lucky enough to draft Blake Griffin, who came into the NBA averaging 20 and 10, you’re usually picking a player for his future rather than his present – upperclassmen included.</p>
<h4><a class="authorbig twentyoneclick" href="javascript:shaleNav('details19');">CLOSE FOOTNOTE</a></h4>
</div></div>

<p>At the end of the day, Uthoff is probably going to be a 2nd-round pick – if he gets drafted at all – which means he’ll most likely be playing in Europe in three years. That’s just how it is for players picked later in the draft. But the same was true for Crowder, Millsap, etc., when they were drafted. If I’m going to take a long-shot, then, I want a guy who acts and plays like the guys who have succeeded before him. For my money, that’s Uthoff. <a class="openfoot" href="javascript:shaleNav('details20');">[20]</a> </p>

<h4>FOOTNOTE 20: A 2ND-ROUNDER'S LONG ODDS</h4>
<p>2nd-round picks from the 2015 draft started a combined 41 games this season – just over one game per player. When you take out Miami’s Josh Richardson (24) and the Lakers’ Anthony Brown (11), though, that leaves just 6 combined starts for the other 28 players selected. Over half of these picks have yet to play in a single NBA game.</p>
<p>Combined, even Richardson and Brown played in just 81 regular season games – 1 fewer than a full season – as they toggled between the D-League and the NBA. Even Richardson, who shot 46.1% from 3 this season (better than Stephen Curry), played in the D-League as late as January 11th before going on to win Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honors in March.</p>
<p>And that’s the best case scenario.</p>
