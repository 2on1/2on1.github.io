			<p>I came to New York City to do one thing: write. Since then, I've discovered
			the value of a diverse technical skillset for a modern, digital-heavy media workspace. That's why I've
			spent my time in New York adding design and code elements to my craft, and it's why I was able to build
			everything you see on this site, from the graphics to the layout and, of course, the words themselves.</p>

			<p><span class=bigletter>I</span> was born and raised in Joplin, Missouri, a small, Midwestern town 
			known best for two things: for being the last place Mickey Mantle played minor league baseball before being called up to 
			play for the Yankees, and for the catastrophic, F-5 tornado that ripped through the city and is considered the most devastating
			in American history.</p>
			<p> I wasn't around in 1950 to watch Mantle win MVP for the Miners, but I did live through the tornado. 
			I spent that night first huddled in a pitch-black bathroom, watching leaves wander through the crack in the door 
			(though that door should have led to a hallway), then wandering through the wreckage of our neighborhood
			to see if the people I had grown up with were still alive.</p> 
			<p>That night, I learned about terror.</p>
			<p>In the aftermath, though, throughout the following summer and years later, I learned a more important lesson - a
			lesson about work. I learned just how much I was capable of from hauling trees, re-tiling floors, and 
			stripping copper wires on days that reached 105 degrees. I learned the value of good work, of the tired-but-satisfied
			feeling you only get when you know you've done everything you can do.</p>
			<p>From the men and women who flocked into the city to help me, my family, and my neighbors, I learned the value of a good
			worker, who doesn't need an invitation to bring his own chainsaw to chop up those fallen trees so someone like
			me could haul them, or to bring cold water to those people on 105-degree days.</p>
			<p>Ever since then, I've prided myself on being a good worker, on making good work. Because if I can survive a tornado,
			and all of the work needed to rebuild a city that came after, then I can certainly stay a little late, arrive a
			little early.</p>
			<p>I'll even bring the chainsaw.</p>
