			<p>I came to New York City to do one thing: write. Since then, I've discovered
			the value of a diverse technical skillset for a modern, digital-heavy media workspace. That's why I've
			spent my time in New York adding design and code elements to my craft, and it's why I was able to build
			everything you see on this site, from the graphics to the layout and, of course, the words themselves.</p>

			<p><span class=bigletter>I</span> was born and raised in Joplin, Missouri, a small, Midwestern town 
			known best for two things: for playing host to Mickey Mantle in his last minor league stop before playing 
			for the Yankees, and for hosting the most devastating tornado in American history. While I wasn't 
			around in 1950 to watch Mantle win MVP for the Miners, I did live through the tornado.</p>
			<p>I spent the first part of that night huddled in a pitch-black bathroom, watching leaves wander 
			through the crack under the door (though that door should have led to a hallway), then wandering 
			through wreckage to see if my neighbors were still alive.</p> 
			<p>That night, I learned about terror.</p>
			<p>In the aftermath, though, throughout the following summer and for years later, I learned a more 
			important lesson about work. I learned just how much I could do - I hauled trees, re-tiled floors, and 
			stripped copper wires in 105-degree heat. I learned the value of good work and about the tired-but-satisfied
			feeling you only get when you know you've done everything you can do.</p>
			<p>Best of all, I learned the value of being a good worker from the men and women who came from
			all over the country to help. They taught me that you don't need an invitation to work, to bring your own 
			chainsaw and chop up those fallen trees so someone like me could haul them or to bring cold water to those
			people who need it.</p>
			<p>Ever since, I've prided myself on being a good worker, on making good work. Because if I can survive a tornado,
			and all of the work that came after, then I can certainly stay a little late, arrive a
			little early ... and when I come, I'll even bring the - metaphorical - chainsaw.</p>
