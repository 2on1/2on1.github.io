     <h2>Why Jrue Holiday is killing Portland</h2>
<p>The Portland Trail Blazers earned the No. 3 seed in a competitive Western Conference largely through the strength of their backcourt. Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum combined to average 48.3 points per game this season, the second-best number for a guard combo in the NBA (only James Harden and Chris Paul averaged more).</p> 
<p>Lillard in particular has been special. He averaged 26.9 points and 6.6 assists, and he’s a good bet to earn 1st Team All-NBA honors for his efforts. </p>
<p>So far, and it’s early, he’s been absolutely manhandled by New Orleans’ Jrue Holiday. Here are three plays that show why Holiday has been the best guard in the series.</p>

                            <h2>Why play No. 1 matters</h2>
      <p>To start the postseason, Holiday has averaged 27 points per game on 54.5 percent shooting -- better on both counts than either of Portland’s guards have mustered. This play shows a big reason why.</p>
              <p>According to NBADraft.net, Holiday measured 6’4.25” in shoes with a 6’7” wingspan and an 8’4.5” standing reach in the 2009 NBA Draft Combine. At first blush, Lillard doesn’t seem much smaller -- according to the same site, Lillard measured 6’2.75” in shoes and had a 6’7.75” wingspan. But, Lillard’s standing reach was 8’ flat, meaning that Holiday is four or five inches taller than Lillard just by sticking his hand out.</p>
<p>Holiday is also listed as about 10 pounds heavier (205 to 195) than Lillard, but watch these highlights, and it will feel like more Just watch that play: Lillard goes over the screen, then gets stuck behind Holiday, who uses his butt to box Lillard out and effectively make him a useless player. Then, just to cap things off, Holiday is big and bouncy enough to finish in the paint over interior defenders.</p>

                            <h2>Why play No. 2 matters</h2>
      <p>Lillard wouldn't need to fight over the top of screens if Holiday were a poor shooter. But Holiday can make enough of them (36 percent from three his career) to keep defenders honest, unlocking the rest of his game.</p>
              <p>Holiday hasn't shot the ball quite as well this year, knocking down 33.7 percent of his attempts, but his shot is clean and he's been in these sorts of spots before. This pull-up jumper comes with 1:37 left in Game 2 with New Orleans up by two points. Shot clock running down, Holiday gets Portland big man Zack Collins in a switch and takes advantage.</p>
              <p>This is a dagger, and Holiday doesn't hesitate.</p>
      
                       <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/2on1/2on1.github.io/blob/master/assets/Jrue3.gif?raw=true">   
      
              <h2>Why play No. 3 matters</h2>
      <p>Despite the impressive numbers on the offensive end, Holiday is just as valuable on defense. Lillard has averaged 17.5 points through two first-round playoff games, down 9.4 from his regular season average -- despite taking 1.1 more shots per game in this series. You could chalk this up to gameplanning or strong team defense, but according to NBA.com, Lillard has shot 2-for-18 when Holiday guards him (11.1 percent) and 11-for-23 (47.8 percent) when everyone else does.</p>
              <p>You can see why Holiday might be such a strong defender in this play. Most point guards just don't finish in the paint like this. They either lack the speed to get open, the strength to gather and rise, or the verticality to dunk on everyone. Holiday makes it look easy. Put that sort of athleticism in front with Anthony Davis behind, and you have a two-headed monster that makes it difficult for opposing guards to get good looks at the rim or from distance.</p>
              <p>New Orleans Head Coach Alvin Gentry said after a Game 2 win (in which Holiday scored 33 points, helping the Pelicans to a 2-0 start) that he might be biased, but he couldn’t name a better two-way player in the NBA right now. It sounds crazy, but Holiday’s offense stems from the same place as his defense: his size and athleticism.</p>
